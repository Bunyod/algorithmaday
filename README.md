# Algorithm-a-day
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pfcoperez/algorithmaday.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pfcoperez/algorithmaday)

This repository holds the source code of several implementations for data structures and algorithms discussed at the Tweeter feed [@DailyAlgorithm](https://twitter.com/DailyAlgorithm).

It's intended to be more a collection, a catalogue, than a library to be included in a project.
